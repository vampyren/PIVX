# SELF-COMPILING PIVX CORE WALLET FOR WINDOWS USING WINDOWS SUBSYSTEM FOR LINUX (WSL)

These are detailed step-by-step instructions for beginners on how to self-compile PIVX Core Wallet on Windows 10 using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) directly from Master branch.

This tutorial is intended for anyone who is willing to help with testing of latest features on **testnet** that PIVX Core Developers are planning to implement on PIVX mainnet. If you find any bugs, please report them directly on PIVX Github:

https://github.com/PIVX-Project/PIVX/issues

**NOTE:** I wouldn't recommend doing this on the same machine where you are running your main PIVX wallet, not to break something and lose/damage your wallet.dat file. If you are doing it, please make sure that you have backup of your wallet.dat file safely stored somewhere before starting this. It's safer to run it on a different machine or Virtual Machine.

---------------------------------------------------------

## Let's start...

## COMPILING THE WALLET FOR THE FIRST TIME

1. Press Windows button on keyboard, search for **Windows PowerShell** and start it. Type the following command:
```
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
```

2. Go to Microsoft Store and download **Ubuntu 18.04 LTS**:

[Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N9TNGVNDL3Q)

3. Setup your username and password and write it down somewhere, you will need it later.
4. Run these commands line by line:
```
sudo dpkg --configure -a
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install build-essential libtool bsdmainutils autotools-dev autoconf pkg-config automake curl git nsis -y
sudo apt install libssl-dev libgmp-dev libevent-dev libboost-all-dev software-properties-common -y
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:pivx/pivx
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install libdb4.8-dev libdb4.8++-dev libminiupnpc-dev libzmq3-dev -y
sudo apt-get install libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a libqt5dbus5 libqt5svg5-dev libqt5charts5-dev qttools5-dev -y
sudo apt-get install qttools5-dev-tools libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libqrencode-dev -y
git clone https://github.com/pivx-project/pivx.git PIVX
cd PIVX
```
5. Next 2 steps are important, after 2nd command, you will be asked and you have to set the default mingw32 g++ compiler option to **posix** (most probably it will be option with number 1):
```
sudo apt install g++-mingw-w64-x86-64
sudo update-alternatives --config x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++
```
6. Run the following commands line by line:
```
PATH=$(echo "$PATH" | sed -e 's/:\/mnt.*//g')
cd depends
make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32
cd ~/PIVX/
```

**NOTE:** At step `make HOST=x86_64-w64-mingw32` above, when you see list like - timer, - wave etc **press the ENTER to continue**...it looks like it gets paused and pressing enter will resume the building process.
Also, even if you get the **conftest.ext - System Error**, don't worry, just **click OK** and it will continue with the process.

7. Run the following commands line by line:
```
./autogen.sh && CONFIG_SITE=$PWD/depends/x86_64-w64-mingw32/share/config.site ./configure --prefix=/
make -j2
cmd.exe /C start "C:\Users\YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu18.04onWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\home\YOUR_WSL_USERNAME\PIVX\src\qt\pivx-qt.exe" --testnet
```
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** From last command, replace `YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME` with your Windows User name, and `YOUR_WSL_USERNAME` with username you used in Step 3 earlier.

**Extra information:**

You can replace the number 2 in `make -j2` line with the number of threads you want to use while compiling, but have in mind that it needs to be less than the amount of processors, otherwise it will slow down the process.

**NOTE:** When running the command `make -j2`, your AntiVirus might show a warning, you can ignore this or in Advanced Options even exclude the file from detection.

**Optional step:**
After you successfully compile the wallet, you can copy-paste the compiled executables to a "fast reachable" folder on your Local Disc, by using the following command after `make -j2`:

```
sudo make install DESTDIR=/mnt/c/workspace/PIVX
```

--------------------------------------------
**Congratulations, you have successfully compiled and started PIVX Qt Core Wallet!**

**That's it, play around with the latest version of PIVX Core Wallet directly compiled from master branch!**

---------------------------------------------
## COMPILING WHEN YOU ALREADY HAVE THE WALLET

Go inside PIVX directory:
```
cd PIVX
git pull origin master
make -j2
cmd.exe /C start "C:\Users\YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu18.04onWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\home\YOUR_WSL_USERNAME\PIVX\src\qt\pivx-qt.exe" --testnet
```
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** From last command, replace `YOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME` with your Windows User name, and `YOUR_WSL_USERNAME` with username you used in Step 3 earlier.

**Extra information:**

You can replace the number 2 in `make -j2` line with the number of threads you want to use while compiling, but have in mind that it needs to be less than the amount of processors, otherwise it will slow down the process.

**Optional step:**
After you successfully compile the wallet, you can copy-paste the compiled executables to a "fast reachable" folder on your Local Disc, by using the following command after `make -j2`:

```
sudo make install DESTDIR=/mnt/c/workspace/PIVX
```

#### **Congratulations, you have successfully compiled and started FRESH PIVX Qt Core Wallet!**
